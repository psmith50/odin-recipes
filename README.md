Round 2 first project!!

This project will demonstate HTML and CSS I have taught myself and learned so far.  A refresh of what I have done in the past and new stuff to throw into the mix and make it awesome.

Skills I've learned so far:
-Git workflow and commands, so git status/log, git add ., git commit, git push, the mantra really is commit often and early.  make sure your messages are clear and consise for others or yourself to read.
-how to fill in a standard index.html document or "boilerplate" and then get to filling in whatever you want to populate your page
-moving around the linux file system with commands, all through the keyboard
-understanding links
